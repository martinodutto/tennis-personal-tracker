_Tennis Personal Tracker_ (a.k.a. _TPT_) is a web application that aims to track all of your tennis activities:

* Matches with your friends
* Matches in tournaments
* Tennis training

It features a very simple and user-friendly GUI, that you can access from your computer as well as from your mobile phone or tablet, since it's built with responsive design techniques.

#### Want to try it?

Even though it is still quite a work in progress, you can try the latest alpha at [www.martinodutto.cloud](https://www.martinodutto.cloud/tennis-personal-tracker/static/)

#### What I plan to release in the future

I'm planning to work at:

* an extensive analytics section, to provide data charts for an immediate feedback on activities (e.g. matches won in the current year, players H2H etc.)
* let you connect your player profile to other TPT users, so that your results are immediately available to your friends.

#### Want to collaborate?

Feel free to send me a pull request: I'm trying to deliver as much features as possible, but any contribution is welcome.
